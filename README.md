# Warframe_Robot
Warframe Robot v0.1

This version is devided from QQ_Robot repositories. The purpose to create Warframe_Robot is to avoid QQ_Robot cannot service any more. Also, the program should not only be an alternative of QQ_Robot. It is independent and specialized program to serve warframe players.

In this robot, I use warframe API and warframe market API to get informations. Deal with data from API and output format messages. All API examples are under "All Examples" folder. Most of them are java script files.
